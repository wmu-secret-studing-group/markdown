# 如何判断电轴方向

- Lead aVF is the isoelectric lead.
- The two perpendiculars to aVF are 0° and 180°.
- Lead I is positive (i.e., oriented to the left).
- Therefore, the axis has to be 0°.

- Lead aVR is the smallest and isoelectric lead.
- The two perpendiculars are -60° and +120°.
- Leads II and III are mostly negative (i.e., moving away from the + left leg)
- The axis, therefore, is -60°.

- Lead aVR is closest to being isoelectric (slightly more positive than negative)
- The two perpendiculars are -60° and +120°
- Lead I is mostly negative; lead III is mostly positive.
- Therefore the axis is close to +120°. Because aVR is slightly more positive, the axis is slightly beyond +120° (i.e., closer to the positive right arm for aVR).
